# Videogames App

This page is simply a sample of an effort to achieve the dream of developing a website, with astronomy as a topic that I liked so much as a child.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Laragon and the lastest PHP version installed before, here are the links provided
    https://laragon.org/download/
    https://windows.php.net/download/

Head to install the 8.4 version and change it in the Window Toolbar where you change settings for Laragon, go to PHP and select the version.

Once all these programs have been downloaded, download the repository in the git terminal within Visual Studio with this command:

    git clone https://github.com/jasanchez97/LaravelEternalGaming.git

## Deployment

One you follow these steps, open Laragon and initiate all services, then open the terminal and insert this command:

    php artisan serve

Now you can visualize the project I did.
